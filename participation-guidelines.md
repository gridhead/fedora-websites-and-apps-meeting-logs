### Participation guidelines

* Please focus on listening, and on appreciating what others are trying to say, not only on what you are hearing.
* Wherever possible, please refrain from multitasking on email or social media and strive to remain fully present and tuned in to what others are saying and feeling.
* Please assume best intent in everyone's comments and strive to keep a constructive tone in your own.
* Please use simple, accessible language. In particular, please avoid jargon and acronyms, so that all may fully participate.
* When you speak, please make just one point and then let others speak. We want everyone to have an equal chance to speak. In a group of "n" people, speak no more than "1/nth" of the time.
* Please speak for yourself when making comments, using "I". Please don't speak for the assembled group by speaking as "we".
* Help us be mindful of the schedule and stay on time; we anticipate many people will have much they want to say, but please support us in moving the dialog forward.

### Please be a self-aware participant!

* Please indicate you want to speak by raising your hand on video or with the button in Jitsi Meet; if you are not able to use or raise your hand, feel free to speak up but please try not to interrupt others.
* Stay muted when you are not speaking.
* Please be mindful of background noise and join the call from a quiet location. Construction sites, windy gardens and non-quarantined internet cafes do not qualify as quiet locations.
* All parents and caregivers shall enjoy an irrevocable "background/foreground kid and dependent noise" exception at all times, but muting etiquette still applies.
