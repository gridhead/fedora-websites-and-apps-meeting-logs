### Topics

* What happened?
    * In a short amount of time, we can began fielding feedback from various Fedora folks:
        * getfedora.org revamp
        * Working with CPE/Fedora Infra and Fedora Design
        * Easyfix revamp
        * On-boarding newcomers who are interested in contributing to a web development project
        * And still run an Objective!!
        * phew.
    * We felt a lot of things: not listened to, misunderstood, ignored, not given the benefit of doubt.
        * Brief open floor for anyone to share kind but honest words.
* What is happening?
    * Evaluating mentorship capacity.
    * More engaged Objective mentorship for program management.
    * Proposals for FE/BE sub-teams, each supporting Design/Infra.
    * Documented meeting etiquette?
        * https://pagure.io/fedora-docs/websites/pull-request/12
* What next?
    * How can we be more kind and excellent to each other going forward?
    * How can we better support each other as a team?

* Thinking about next steps:
    * Objective and Development meetings.
        * Current meetings are focused on development, which is important. But also need more focus on Objective and meeting milestones.
    * Backend/Frontend?
        * Need a proposal. Co-lead meeting to explore the structure?
    * Picking and prioritizing our projects.
        * getfedora.org is a big project!
        * Is there a smaller project for us to take on as a trial project? MÃ¸te?, Badges or something else? Easyfix may be since the mockups and other related info is available already
        * Fedora Bootstrap: Component instead of a project
            * Wider impact by improving Fedora Bootstrap
            * Then, updating other projects becomes easier
