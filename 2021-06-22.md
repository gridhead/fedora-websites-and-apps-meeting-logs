    * Survey Banner
        * Documentation of processes to get banner up 
            * New issue under docs/websites
        * Banner removal end of June 
        * We feel this really improved our survey numbers and would like to implement banners in the future for other things (Nest 2021 registration for example)
        * We need volunteers to remove the banners on June 30th
    * Happiness packets: Does W&A want to help out with getting happiness packets back up and running?
        * JWF: Capacity check?
        * Can OSPO host this?
    * Jon talked with Misc and his thoughts were that getfedora has a lot of people who need to approve changes to it so we might want to start by revamping/porting other websites first to build our teams reputation and having something to point to before we try and tackle getfedora. This way we will probably face fewer roadblocks
        * arm.fedoraproject.org
        * spins.fedoraproject.org
        * boot.fedoraproject.org
        * alt.fedoraproject.org
        * https://pagure.io/fedora-websites
        * https://pagure.io/fedora-web/websites [This needs versioning]
    * Also, the pages like getfedora are currently servered statically I believe and using a webframework to host them would be a big change from what Jon thinks most people would expect on a rewrite for these pages. But if we decide a framework is the right way to go Jon thinks it should be hosted in Kubernetes because the images for most images are already managed by [github.com/sclorg](https://github.com/sclorg)
    * Python 2 to Python 3 port for websites completed but not yet merged
