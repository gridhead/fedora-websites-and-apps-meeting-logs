### Agenda
- Discussion on Easyfix's direction and prolly sunset
    - Contributor.link can be a good successor for Easyfix
- What Can I Do For Fedora?
    - Judging if it is going to be worth our time to contribute to
    - Lower priority than the websites revamp but we would want to talk about it
    - If we want to push the project as something which is accessible and can be contributed to, we would definitely want to discuss about it alongside the websites revamp.
    - Active reaching out is needed - dub it CONTEXTUAL APPROACH - suggest testing downloads aside stable to encourage QA participation - watching articles and suggest participation as documentation and writing - 
- Discussion on moving repos to the GitLab namespace
    - We would be able to make use the lot of CI/CD option in the future
- Discussion on Mote's progress
    - Lower down the hierarchy of the About button
    - Remove the buttons from the center and have those in the tabs
    - Week view of calendar and show the meetings on the main page as a replacement to the buttons
    - Show the recent meetings directly on the main screen without having to click on the RECENT button
    - Search function has to be implemented on the menu than on a modal as that requires more effort in the usability
    - Have calendar view to show meetings in a channel and dots on DATE to show the meetings that happened on that date
    - If a meeting channel goes inactive - we can have a notification to show when the last meeting happened
    - We would want to show metrics about how active the channels have just like the ones in mailing lists on hyperkitty
