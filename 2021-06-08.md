    * Not sure if its discussion topic or not but Allan Day said in the Fedora GNOME meeting earlier today that Fedora Workstation would want a new website as the screenshots is from Fedora 22 and has very old information, when you are more set up and has the ball rolling would be good if someone could talk with @aday 
    * Change all Freenode to Libera.chat on the Websites 
    * Upgrade to a newer version of Python Python3 instead of Python2 for all sites/services as Python2 is EOL

    * Try to agree on what website/development stack to use
    * Have a Hackfest Virtual / Mobprogramming with each other 
    * Create a Docs page for the Website team with more information about the meetings/calls and other practical information
