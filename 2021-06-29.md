        * Hi, I cant make it today, my apologies. I wanted to say THANK YOU! again for working on the banner survey and remind folks that it needs to come down tomorrow. 
        * I am working on the registration for Nest with Fedora and am having a banner made for this as well. I should have the art & registration link by this upcoming Friday. If we could get them up onto the websites within the week or two after that would be awesome!
