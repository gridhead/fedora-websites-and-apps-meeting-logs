        * Review details, 
        * https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/t/fedora-objective-proposal-websites-apps-community-revamp/28736?u=jflory7
            * We will leave this open for one week, incorporate feedback, and open a council ticket next week
        * How to propose an objective: https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/project/objectives/

    * Documentation updates: What would be most helpful right now?
        * What kinds of questions have people heard? What are common problems or questions we want to answer with our documentation?
            * Docs are currently out of date
            * It is perceived as an easyfix type task
            * We need to be visible, make sure our presence is felt

        * Static vs. dynamic websites/apps?
            * Would this help to provide better entrypoints based on required skill set and level of experience?
            * Mentors could work across both

    * How to be involved with the infrastructure team
        * An Objective co-lead could help as a liaison to the Infrastructure / CPE team
        * **Pingou shared the below email with the team since he couldn't make it today**:
            * I just wanted to let you know an idea that I had about the website & apps team.
            * I would suggest the team move its discussions to the fedora infrastructure list as they will need to work with that team (and thus becoming part of it) as they work on websites and apps. So moving the discussions there would help making them visible (I doubt many people are aware that this is spinning up) as well as help the infrastructure team see and understand what they are trying to do and where they need help (be that access or resources).
            * The Infrastructure team is bigger than the CPE team, so they can fully join that group and form a team there.
